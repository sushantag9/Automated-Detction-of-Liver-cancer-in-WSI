## Automated Detction of Liver cancer in WSI

This project focuses on detection and segmentation of liver cancer in WSI using parallel processing on GPU and used techniques of pruning to improve and optimize my model. The baseline of the model is Unet and Vnet. Further the model has been upgraded with a ResNet backbone and model pruning technique were also applied.
### Technology: Python, Deep Learning, AI for Medical Analysis
